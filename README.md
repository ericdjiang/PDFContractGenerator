# PDF Contract Generator
This is a website which allows users to input contact information/signature to generate a templated PDF contract. It uses pure Javascript, built on top of the JSPDF library to generate professional, customizable PDF contracts.

## Usage
Form inputs fields for the contract can be added or deleted as needed from /index.html. 
```<p> First Name </p>
<input class="inp" name = "first_name" type="text" id = "first_name">
```
Contract content and styling can be changed in /scripts/index.js
